    <h1><center> Stovetop Oven </h1>
     
     <h2 class="grey">1. Introduction </h2>
	 <p> Most homes have a stovetop oven for its dual convenience of being able to use the stove and the oven at the same place, same time. However, the stovetop oven interface at 
	 my apartment ,although functionally convenience, is not very convenient in terms of usability. Some functionalities like setting a clock, timer,temperature have the same set of buttons
	 so it gets confusing what to use for setting it on/off. Additionally, keeping buttons for incrementing and decrementing the timer/temperature/clock becomes a very annoying task given
	 that 1 button push = 1 count incrementer/decrement. 
     
     <h2 class="grey">2. Interface Display </h2>
    <img src="/images/oven_UI.jpg" alt="Oven UI" width="1450px" height="300px" border = "3" align = "center"/>
    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;" align="center-left">
      <li> This is what the stove-top oven looks like in a normal setting. It displays the clock. You can adjust the clock using the TEMP.TIME controls </li>
	  <li> This is the temperature when you click on either Bake/Broil/Warm and/or any of the the Bake Assist Temps. You can increase/decrease the temperature using the TEMP.TIME controls</li>
	  <li> This is the Timer display when you push the Timer Set/Off button and increase/decrease using the TEMP.TIME controls. </li>
	</ol>
	
     <h2 class="grey">3. User Research & Interview </h2>
	<p align = "left"> I had the following users use the interface on a weekday morning to prepare their breakfast:</p>
	<ul align = "left">
	<li> Annie, a 50 years old homemaker - struggled to figure out what buttons to press. </li>
	<li> Jane, a 20 years old student - initially struggled but pressed some buttons based on assumptions. She placed a bread to bake only to find out 10 mins later that nothing happened as the bread was still cold. She then tried some other trial-error combinations and it finally worked.
	<li> Mandy, a 30 years old working professional - struggled for the 1st few seconds and then directly pressed Bake + Start and that's it.
	
        <h3 align="left">Prepared Questions and Answers</h3>
        <ol align="left">
        <li><h3>What are your thoughts about the interface primafacie?</h3></li>
		<p> Annie, Jane, and Mandy all responded that the interface looked pretty simple and easy to use when they had their first look. They liked that there were not too many buttons to deal with
		and assumed that would make it easy to use</p>
        <li><h3>If you were to bake a cake, what steps would you follow to use this oven?</h3></li>
		<p> Annie reported that she would first press 'Start' followed by Bake, followed by Bake Assist 420F to preheat the oven. Once preheated,she will select 'Cancel, place the cake in the rack, select 'Start' followed by Bake. Then she will increase the temperature using the temperature controls.</p>
		<p> Jane and Mandy reported that they would first press 'Bake Assist 420F' and then hit Start. Once preheated, they will place the cake in the rack and select 'Bake' followed by adjusting the temperature setting using the temperature controls and then hit 'Start'.</p>
        <li><h3>Does anything about this interface confuse you?</li></h3>
		<p> Annie, Jane, and Mandy reported that they found it too confusing to have the same pair of buttons to control the temperature + timer + clock. </p> 
        <p> Additionally, Annie also mentioned that she finds it confusing as to what to press first -'Start' or 'Bake' or 'Bake Assist'. </p>
        <li><h3>Would you like to use this interface very often (twice a week) ?</li></h3>
		<p> They all responded in positive that if they figure it out, they don't mind using it frequently. </p>
        <li><h3>Is there something that you'd like to change about this interface?</li></h3>
		<p> Mandy reported that she would like more assitance - what if she wants to Broil instead? Will the steps be the same? </p>
		<p> Jane and Mandy reported that they want to be able to operate things faster. The current timer/temperature/clock setting takes too long given the same pair of setting controls buttons.</p>
		<li><h3>What is your ideal stovetop-oven interface like?</li></h3>
		<p> Mandy said that she would like it to be easy to navigate from Start to End.</p>
		<p> Jane and Mandy emphasized that the process should be quick. </p> 
	  </ol>
  
      <h2 class="grey">4. Personas </h2>
	  <h3 align="center-left"> Persona 1: Assumer Sandie </h3>
	  <p> Sandie loves to bake and grill and the stovetop-oven fulfils that purpose. She has a fair experience with using electronic devices. 
	  Most of the electronic devices that she has used always start by pressing the 'Start' button to activate the device and then you assign the functionality - the TV starts only after you hit the 'Start' button (power button /on-off button), the treadmill in the gym starts once you hit the 'Start' button, your phone starts once you hit the 'Start' (power) button.</p>
	  <p> Thus, Sandie's mental model makes them assume that like all the other devices, even this device will start by clicking the 'Start' button so she does that only to realize that nothing happened. This is when she realizes that not all devices work the same way even with a similar interface. </p>

	  <h3 align="center-left"> Persona 2: Impatient Maggie</h3>
		<p> Maggie represents the millenial generation where we want everything to be quick. Maggie tries multiple rational combinations of control buttons to see what works.
		She also dislikes the temperature/timer/clock control as it requires constant clicks(increase/decrease)so it is tedious and slow. </p>

      <h2 class="grey">4. Storyboarding </h2>
	 <img class ="center" src="/images/sb_1.png" alt="Assumer Sandie Storyboard" width="1200px" height="800px" border = "3"/>
	 
         <p> Storyboard pertains to Sandie's persona because: </p>
	 <ul align = "center-left">
	 <li> It <strong> reflects her mental model </strong> about assuming how devices have similar way of functioning with common features like Start,Stop,Increase/Decrease.</li>
	 <li> It also <strong> explores her feelings </strong>(confused, embarrased, frustrated, happy) throughout her user journey when interacting with the interface. </li>
	 <li> It <strong> demonstrates her ability to adapt </strong> to a new technology interface fairly quickly. </li>
         </ul>
